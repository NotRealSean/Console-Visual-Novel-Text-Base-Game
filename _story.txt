[Girl]: "I-Is this ok...?"
[Boss]: "Is this all you can do in one week? USELESS. Don't come back if there's no progress at all!"
[Girl]: "! ... Yes..."

A. office worker girl had been working hard for a month straight, but her boss complains again.
She tries her best on her work, but other co-workers like to put their work on her, and only her, for some reason, which makes her work not progress at all.
All the co-workers already know this, but they don't care.

[Girl]: " ... "
[Co-worker 1]: "Can you help me with this work?"
[Girl]: "I-I still hav- "
[Co-worker 1]: "Thank you."
[Girl]: " ... again..."

She sometimes thinks about quitting her job and finding a better one, but no one wants to hire her to work because they already have a lot of employees at their office.

[Girl]: " ... Maybe... just maybe... What if I die and was reborn in another world like in isekai novel. Just saying, haha..."

She likes to read isekai novels during her free time. She often thinks about killing herself and living a happier life in the afterlife.

[Girl]: "It's 8 PM already? Maybe I should go home and make something to eat for dinne- "
[Girl]: " ... Why is everything black... I can't see anything... What happened to me."
